MULTIPLAYER PONG

The project will consist of a 2-player pong game. It will use 2 sets of
Arduinos, joysticks and LCD screens. The same game session will be displayed
in both screens and each player will control their paddle using their
joystick. When a player can't hit the ball, the opposite player wins a point. 
The first player to score 5 points wins.

We shouldn't have problems with syncronization between the two games because
the delay between the arduinos is very low (<2 ms) and we'll set it up so that
they communicate at 2 MiB / s. If that doesn't work we'll implemente TSS
(Trailing State Synchronization) and that should take care of any extra issue.

Milestones:

1) Nov 22 - PADDLES: Make the paddles show up on the screen and have the players
control them. 

2) Nov 25 - SYNC SCREENS: The screens should be in sync, such that moving a paddle on one
screen makes the paddle move on the other.

3) Nov 28 - BALL: Code the ball. Make it react to the walls and the paddles.

4) Nov 30 - KEEP SCORE: create a system to keep score of the game. Have it display on
the screen game stats at the end.
